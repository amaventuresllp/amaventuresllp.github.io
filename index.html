						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">scope</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>  The electric vehicle market is expected to grow rapidly and is expected that it will be worth at least around $5.7 billion by 2025.
The continuous efforts towards standardization of all EV chargers will lead to increase in the demand of public affordable charging network thus will open up huge opportunities in this sector.
 The Charging Infrastructure is the backbone for adoption of E-mobility. But, it is also a key barrier in adoption of electric vehicles in India. The Government of India and various State Governments are promoting the adoption of Electric Vehicles through various schemes for the public at large by in the form of subsidies at the same time the Government is also promoting the EV charging Infrastructure to cater to the ever increasing demand of Electric Vehicles.

                As per government and non-government research, India will need at least 29 lakh public charging stations to cater to growing needs of electric vehicles. Out of 29 lakh public chargers 70% would be utilized by 2W and 3W. At present India is lagging behind most of the countries in terms of existing charging infrastructure viz 26 EV’s behind each Charging station compared to 8 in China and 17 in the USA. The under developed field of charging infrastructure for Ev’s also gives an opportunity to various stake holders to develop businesses in and around charging infrastructure.

                Although, home charging is the most preferred mode of charging, still it cannot cater to the majority ev owners. The space constraint, off street parking, communities with shared parking as well as gated communities create hurdles in setting up of home charging solutions. Therefore, it is need of the day to develop setting up of reliable public charging points to encourage the end user for adoption of electric vehicles. There is a huge vaccum in availability of charging components for setting up a home charger other that the one provided by the EV company.

                To achieve the ambitious target of EV adoption by the Government, it is just and necessary to maintain a balanced ratio of Electric Vehicles and charging Infrastructure to promote and motivate EV adoption by reducing range axiety.
